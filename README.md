## Machine Learning
Ability of a machine to learn and improve from experience rather than explicit programming.

Types of machine learning :<br>
  üü¢ Supervised<br>
  üü¢ Unsupervised<br>
  üü¢ Reinforcement<br>

## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement means encouraging a pattern or behaviour. This form of ML is a _hit and trail_ method, because the model is new to the surroundings. The only way to learn is to experience and then, learn from that experience.
