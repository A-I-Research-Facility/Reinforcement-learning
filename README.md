## Machine Learning
Ability of a machine to learn and improve from experience rather than explicit programming.

## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement means encouraging a pattern or behaviour. This form of ML is a _hit and trial_ method, because the model is new to the surroundings. The only way to learn is to experience and then, learn from that experience. 

The main idea is to learn through a "Reward and Punishment" system. For every correct move, there is a reward, for every wrong one, there is a punishment. The model tries to maximise the reward.

It is to be noted that 'training' datasets are not present here. Neither the fed data is classified or labled. The model needs to figure out the path and the best approach to perform a certain task. The environment is also unknown to the agent.

Let's suppose a baby is learning to walk.
